Hello, Iâ€™m Hatice. I am a Software Engineering student at InÃ¶nÃ¼ University. My education and personal experiences in technology entrepreneurship have equipped me with invaluable skills in developing projects and transforming them into start-ups. As a result of my education and personal experiences, I have honed my expertise in various fields, including mobile programming, cybersecurity, database management and web programming.

My deep interest in emerging technologies and passion for learning continuously drive me to keep up with the latest trends and innovations in the industry. My goal is to become a proficient software developer and a successful start-up founder, with a strong focus on creating social impact. I have a curious, ambitious, and assertive personality; learning and self-improvement are my way of life. I am committed to pushing the boundaries of my knowledge and experience to make a difference. I firmly believe that without trying, we can never truly know what we are capable of achieving. The key to making a difference lies in taking risks and daring to try.
